## Introduction
Comm is a web application that allows users to upload, review, and analyze their videos. Whether you're looking to receive feedback or gain insights from your content, Comm has you covered.

## Architecture Overview
Comm follows a client-server architecture. The backend is developed using Ruby on Rails, providing robust APIs, while the frontend is built with React for a dynamic and responsive user interface.

## Backend (Ruby on Rails)
# Setup and Installation
To get started with the Comm backend, follow these steps:

Clone this repository.
Navigate to the backend directory.
Install dependencies using bundle install.
Set up the database with rails db:create db:migrate.
Start the server using rails server.
# Models
Comm uses the following models:

User: Manages user information.
Video: Represents uploaded videos and associated metadata.
Comment: Stores user comments on videos.
# Controllers
Backend controllers handle user requests and interactions, ensuring proper communication between the frontend and backend.

# Views
Views in the backend, if applicable, render HTML templates for server-side rendering. Comm primarily uses React on the frontend for a more dynamic experience.

# APIs
Explore the Comm backend APIs by referring to the API Documentation for detailed information on endpoints, request methods, and response formats.

## Frontend (React)
Setup and Installation
To set up the Comm frontend, follow these steps:

Navigate to the frontend directory.
Install dependencies using npm install or yarn install.
Start the development server with npm start or yarn start.
# Components
Comm's frontend is structured with reusable components such as LoginForm, VideoUploadForm, CommentSection, and more. Check out the Components section for detailed descriptions.

# Routing
React Router is employed for client-side routing, ensuring smooth navigation between different views within the application.

# API Integration
Axios is used to interact with the Comm backend APIs. Explore the API Integration section for details on making HTTP requests.

# Styling
Comm is styled for an optimal user experience using Styled-components for dynamic and responsive designs.

# Security and Authentication
Comm prioritizes security by implementing JWT authentication, preventing cross-site scripting (XSS), and configuring Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).

# Testing
Explore the Testing section for information on unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, ensuring the reliability of Comm's codebase.

# Deployment
Refer to the Deployment section for instructions on deploying Comm to platforms like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean.

# Conclusion
